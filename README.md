### Hi ya!

I received my PhD in low order climate models in 2025, from the Royal Meteorological Institute of Belgium and UC Louvain. An example of my recent research can be found in the journal [Chaos](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/cha/article/35/8/083126/3358767/Using-unstable-periodic-orbits-to-understand), and [here](https://oisinhamilton.com/_publications/2025-08-14_UPOs_and_blocking) is a blog post that I wrote about it.
